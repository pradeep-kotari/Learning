<p><strong>Hey everyone — Welcome to the First Batch!</strong></p>
<p>You’re not just joining a program.<br>
You’re stepping into a <strong>movement</strong> that puts power back in the hands of students — not coaching centers, not colleges, and definitely not luck.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="our-mission"><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h3>
<p>To help students from <strong>Tier 2, Tier 3 colleges and non-IITs</strong> in India become <strong>job-ready</strong>, <strong>confident</strong>, and <strong>in-demand</strong> — using just one currency: <strong>your time and hard work.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>No fees. No false promises. Just real growth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe talent is <strong>everywhere</strong> — not just in IITs.<br>
You don’t need a brand-name college to get a great job.<br>
You just need a <strong>chance to prove yourself</strong> — and we’re here to give you that.</p>

If you show up consistently, <strong>your work will speak louder than your degree.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s make this the generation where Tier 2/3 engineers <strong>lead the industry</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s prove India’s talent isn’t locked behind an IIT tag.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s go.</strong></p>
